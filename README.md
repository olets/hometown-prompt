**Hometown is a feature rich, high performance Git-aware zsh theme** with segments for the user, host, time, the current working directory and its parent, and ‚Äîwithin a Git repo‚Äî detailed Git status. It is carefully designed to show a lot of information clearly.

## Documentation

&nbsp;

üìñ See the guide, including a web simulation demonstrating how the prompt responds to context and configuration, at https://hometown-prompt.olets.dev/

&nbsp;

## Screencast

Here's a screencast showing it in action, as a gif. Note that when you "accept" the command line (that is, hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>) the prompt trims down. You can view the same screencast as a video, with controls to pause, rewind, and fast forward, on the [Hometown docs site](https://hometown-prompt.olets.dev/).

## Appearance

By default it looks something like this. Time, current working directory, and Git ref info on the first line (using symbols, with inactive status data points hidden); Git file info on the second (using symbols, with disabled symbols for inactive status data points); and the prompt character on the third.

It has numerous layout and content toggles.

For example you can mix and match line break options, hidden/disabled options, and word/symbol options in any way you like.

With very little configuration it can look, for example, like this. Time, current working directory, Git ref info (using symbols, with inactive status data points hidden); and Git file info (using symbols, with inactive status data points hidden) on the first line; and the prompt character on the second.

![Hometown Prompt screenshot, default configuration](/assets/hometown-prompt-short.png)

Or like this. Time and current working directory on the first line; Git ref info (using words, with disabled symbols for inactive branch data points) on the second line; Git file info (using words, with inactive status data points hidden) on the third line; and the prompt character on the fourth.

You can also customize colors, text, symbols, and the slot which in these screenshots is the time. Here's just one of the infinite possibilities:
